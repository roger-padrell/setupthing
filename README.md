# SetupThing
## What is this?
SetupThing is a web tool to easily create and manage setup presets (especially in Linux).

The idea is to be able to install single programs or whole groups of them with simple commands (inspired in [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)).

## How to use it?
### Open the page
First, you need to go to the website (available at [setupthing.deno.dev](https://setupthing.deno.dev/)).
